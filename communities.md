## Linked entities

### SubCommunities
**/api/core/communities/<:uuid>/subcommunities**

Example: t.b.p

It returns the direct sub-communities within this community. Please note that, to provide good performance, 
the REST API uses information flatten and stored in SOLR at the time of item indexing that could become stale 
when new delegation are enabled (i.e. a community or collection admin group are created). In such case you are 
advised to reindex your items. This doesn't apply when your delegation are already inplace and you only change 
the members of an admin group, these changes are immediately visible without any need to reindex. 

The supported parameters are:
* page, size [see pagination](README.md#Pagination)
 

### Collections
**/api/core/communities/<:uuid>/collections**

Example: <https://demo.dspace.org/server/#https://demo.dspace.org/server/api/core/communities/7669c72a-3f2a-451f-a3b9-9210e7a4c02f/collections>

It returns the collections direct children of this community. Please note that, to provide good performance, 
the REST API uses information flatten and stored in SOLR at the time of item indexing that could become stale 
when new delegation are enabled (i.e. a community or collection admin group are created). In such case you are 
advised to reindex your items. This doesn't apply when your delegation are already inplace and you only change 
the members of an admin group, these changes are immediately visible without any need to reindex.

The supported parameters are:
* page, size [see pagination](README.md#Pagination)
