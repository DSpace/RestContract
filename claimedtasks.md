If successful a 201 code will be returned along with the new claimedtask. The pooltask will also be removed.

An example curl call:

```bash
curl -i -X POST https://api7.dspace.org/server/api/workflow/claimedtasks
\ -H "Content-Type:text/uri-list" \
--data "https://api7.dspace.org/server/api/workflow/pooltasks/1"

201 Created - if the operation succeed
401 Unauthorized - if you are not authenticated
403 Forbidden - if the logged in user is not the reviewer of the pooltask
422 Unprocessable Entity - if the pooltask provided doesn't exist

## POST Method (single resource level)

To perform a claimed task a POST request must be issued against the single claimed task URL
/api/workflow/claimedtasks/:id
using http request parameters to instruct the workflow action class about the specific command to perform approve,
reject, add a score, etc. In some case other parameters must be specified too as for instance the reason parameter for
the reject action
