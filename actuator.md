# Actuator

Actuator endpoints let you monitor and interact with DSpace. By default, the following endpoints are enabled:

**/actuator/info**: Displays arbitrary application info. Only administrators can access this endpoint.
To modify the data exposed by the info endpoint, you can add properties with info prefix to the `actuator.cfg`.
configuration file.

**/actuator/health**: Shows application health information. The status is calculated based on the aggregation of the
status of the configured components; only the administrator can see the detail of the components.
To see the status of a single component, contact the endpoint `/actuator/health/{component}`.
The statuses that the application can have are:

* UP: the application is up and running without issues.
* UP_WITH_ISSUES: the application is up and running non-blocking issues.
* OUT_OF_SERVICE: the application has critical issues.
* DOWN: the application has fatal issues.
