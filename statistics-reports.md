## Statistics for a DSpaceObject

**GET /api/statistics/usagereports**

As we don't have a use case to iterate over all the existing usage reports, the main endpoint is not implemented and a
405 error code is returned according to our [general error response codes](README.md#Error-codes).

## Single statistic

**GET /api/statistics/usagereports/<:id>**

This endpoint provides a specific statistic

An example JSON response document to `/api/statistics/usagereports/1911e8a4-6939-490c-b58b-a5d70f8d91fb_TopCountries`:

```json
{
  "id": "1911e8a4-6939-490c-b58b-a5d70f8d91fb_TopCountries",
  "type": "usagereport",
  "report-type": "TopCountries",
  "points": [
    {
      "label": "United States",
      "type": "country",
      "id": "US",
      "values": {
        "views": 2
      }
    },
    {
      "label": "China",
      "type": "country",
      "id": "CN",
      "values": {
        "views": 1
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The ID is built from a concatenation of the UUID and the type of report for the given UUID

The type of point can be:

* country
* city
* bitstream
* item
* collection
* community
* date

The report-type specifies what data is returned, relevant e.g. to add a label to report. The current statistics support:

* TotalVisits
* TotalVisitsPerMonth
* TotalDownloads
* TopCountries
* TopCities

Possible response status

- 200 OK - The specific statistics data was found, and the data has been properly returned.

* 401 Unauthorized - if you are not authenticated and the statistics are not available to the Anonymous user
* 403 Forbidden - if you are not logged in with sufficient permissions and the statistics are not available to the
  Anonymous user

- 404 Not Found - The specified ID was not found

## Search Statistics for a DSpaceObject

**GET /api/statistics/usagereports/search/object**

This endpoint provides a paginated list of statistics for a DSpaceObject.

The DSpaceObject is given through the following parameters:

- `uri` The object to retrieve statistics for. The full URI of the rest resource must be specified, i.e. https:
  //{dspace.url}/server/api/core/community/{uuid}

The usual parameters for paginated lists are supported as well:

- `page` The page number
- `size` The number of reports in a page
