## Search methods

### Find by Item

**/api/core/supervisionorders/search/byItem?uuid=<:item-uuid1>**

This method returns a list of supervision orders defined for an item whose uuid is passed as parameter to the query

The supported parameters are:

* uuid: mandatory. The uuid of the item for which supervision order must be found

Return codes:

* 200 OK - if the operation succeed. Including the case where item exists but does not have any supervision order
  defined.
* 400 Bad Request - if uuid parameter is missing or syntactically invalid (not an uuid)
* 404 Not found - if no items are found for the uuid.

## Creating a supervision order

**POST /api/core/supervisionorders?uuid=<:item uuid>&group=<:group uuid>&type=<:type>**

The supported parameters are:

* uuid: mandatory. The uuid of the item for which supervision order must be created
* group: mandatory. The uuid of the group whose members will be supervisors
* type: mandatory. The type of permissions to be granted to above group's members:
    * NONE: no grants
    * EDITOR: READ and WRITE permissions will be added to item and its bitstreams
    * OBSERVER: READ permissions will be added to item and its bitstreams

A sample CURL command would be:

```bash
curl -i -X POST 'https://api7.dspace.org/server/api/core/supervisionorders?uuid=<uuid>&group=<group uuid>&type=NONE' -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJrasdfw…' 
```

* 201 Created - if the operation succeed
* 401 Unauthorized - if you are not authenticated
* 400 Bad Request - if both or one among the uuid or group parameter is missing or syntactically invalid (not an uuid),
  or if they resolve to an unexpected DSpace Object type.

* 422 Unprocessable Entity - if one among item or group does not exist, if a supervision order for the same group
  already exists, or if the item referenced by uuid is not an inprogress submission. A Supervision order can be created
  only when the item is in the submission or workflow process

## Deleting a supervision order
