# Submission-Forms Endpoints

[Back to the list of all defined endpoints](endpoints.md)

A submission-form represents a single data entry form, associated with a submission section. It is configurable, and
consists of one or more data entry fields. In DSpace 6 and below, this concept was called an "input-form" and was
configured via input-forms.xml.

## Main Endpoint

**/api/config/submissionforms**

Provide access to the configured submission-forms. It returns the list of existent submission-forms.
Please note that from DSpace 7 the submission-form concept has been introduced splitting the previous configuration file
named input-forms.xml by page. Each submission-form describes a single page of inputs, combining different pages
together is done with the [submission-definition](submissiondefinitions.md), aka the item-submission.xml configuration
file

Example: to be provided

## Single Submission-Form

**/api/config/submissionforms/<:form-name>**

Provide detailed information about a specific input-form. The JSON response document is as follows:

The json has an ordered array named rows containing the fields that need to be rendered. The structure of each field is
as follows:

* input: contains the details about the widget `type` to use (onebox, dropdown, date, etc.) and if applicable a `regex`
  to use to validate user input. Some input types provide specific behaviors:
    * `dropdown` type: requires use of a (non-hierarchical) controlled vocabulary. Provides a selectbox/dropdown of
      entries within that vocabulary.
    * `lookup` type: requires use of a controlled vocabulary. Provides searching capabilities across that vocabulary to
      select a specific entry or entries.
    * `lookup-name` type: Same as `lookup`, but specific to names.
    * `onebox` type: acts as a single text input field. Would provide auto-suggest capabilities when associated with a (
      non-hierarchical) controlled vocabulary. If the associated controlled vocabulary is
      hierarchical (`hieararchical=true`), then the onebox input type provides access to the hierarchical selection tree
      for that vocabulary.
* scope: the *scope* attribute can be null or one of the values: workflow or submission. A value other than null mean
  that the visibility of the field in the specified scope is defined by the value of the attribute *visibility.main* and
  *visibility.other* in the other scope. *Null* mean that the field will be visible in both the submission and workflow
  with the visibility specified in *visibility.main*
* visibility: the visibility attributes can assume one of the following values
    * `null` : editable
    * `readonly`: visible but not alterable
    * `hidden`: not visible
* label: the label to present to the user for this field
* mandatory: *true* if the user must provide a value for this field
* repeatable: *true* if the field allows multiple values
* mandatoryMessage: the error message to present to the user if no value is supplied for this field
* hints: contextual help to present to the user for this field
* style: css class or classes to apply to the html components related to this field. They should be added as is to the
  html block containing the field, it can be for example col-md-3 to constraint the field in the bootstrap grid
* selectableMetadata: most time one field is associated exactly with one metadata but it is possible, using
  the `qualdrop_value` in the `submission-forms.xml`, to associate one field with a list of different qualified
  metadata. In such case the selectableMetadata will contain an actual array of available metadata for the field
  otherwise, a single entry will be present. Each entry in the selecatebleMetadata array will be as follows:
    * metadata: the key of the metadata field to use to store the input
    * controlledVocabulary: the name of the controlled vocabulary used to retrieve value for the
      input [see controlled vocabularies](vocabularies.md)
    * label: an optional label to associate with the selector of the metadata
* selectableRelationship: it is similar to the selectableMetadata but used when the field use relations underhood
    * relationshipType: the name of the [relationship](relationshiptypes.md)
    * filter: a filter to apply searching for candidate related items
    * searchConfiguration: the name of
      the [discovery configuration](search-endpoint.md#matching-dspace-objects-search-results) to use to search for
      candidate related items
    * externalSources: a list of [external source](external-authority-sources.md) names which can be used in a lookup.
      This can be empty to state no external sources should be used
    * nameVariants: It defines whether an alternative name can be used for the stored relation with the entity (in the
      relationship)
* languageCodes contains the array of languages that can be assigned to a user input. For each language it is present a
  *display* string (i.e. English, Italian, etc.) and a *code* (i.e. en, it).
* typeBind contains an array of publication type values for which this field applies (e.g. Book, Article). This field
  should be hidden and ignored if the item has a different or empty type. An empty typeBind array indicates that this
  field applies to *all* publication types.

It is important to note that the field definition contains special attributes in selectableMetadata and
selectableRelationship that in an ideal HAL representation should be replaced with links but for simplicity we have
preferred to expose as string.
