IMPLEMENTED**

Example: to be provided

## Single Request

**/api/tools/itemrequests/<:token>**

Provide detailed information about a specific request. The JSON response document will resemble this:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "decisionDate": null,
  "expires": null,
  "requestDate": "2021-09-17T14:55:50.089+00:00",

  "allfiles": false,
  "type": "itemrequest",
  "bitstreamId": "dca2dadb-7028-40a9-ab39-1a47726df7ef",

  "requestEmail": "jsmith@example.com",
  "requestMessage": "Please send me a copy of this.",
  "requestName": "John Smith",
  "_links": {
    "bitstream": {
      "href": "https://api7.dspace.org/server/api/tools/itemrequests/1/bitstream"
    },
    "item": {
      "href": "https://api7.dspace.org/server/api/tools/itemrequests/1/item"
    },
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api7.dspace.org/server/api/tools/itemrequests/1"
    }
  }
}
```

Item properties:

* type: always "itemrequest". READ-ONLY
* id: internal unique identifier of the request. READ-ONLY
* itemId: UUID of the requested Item.
* bitstreamId: UUID of the requested bitstream.
* allfiles: true if the request is for all bitstreams of the item.
* requestEmail: email address of the person requesting the files.

* requestDate: date that the request was recorded. READ-ONLY.
* expires: date on which the request is considered expired.
* acceptRequest: true if the request has been granted.
* decisionDate: date that the request was granted or denied. READ-ONLY.
* token: opaque string which uniquely identifies this request. READ-ONLY

Exposed links:

* item: the item requested
* bitstream: the bitstream requested

Return codes:

* 200 OK - if the operation succeeded
* 404 NOT FOUND - if the token is unknown (no such request exists)

## Creating a Request

**POST /api/tools/itemrequests**

Anyone may create an item request. The Content-Type is JSON. Example:

```json
{
  "itemId": "71d9fb0c-cc36-41c1-b1d3-63887b414fca",
  "allfiles": false,
  "bitstreamId": "dca2dadb-7028-40a9-ab39-1a47726df7ef",
  "requestEmail": "jqpublic@example.com",
  "requestName": "John Q. Public",
  "requestMessage": "Please send this to me."
}
```

`bitstreamId` is ignored and may be omitted if `allfiles` is `false`.  `requestMessage` is optional.  `requestEmail`
and `requestName` are ignored and may be omitted if the session is authenticated -- these fields will be filled from the
session user's EPerson. If the session is anonymous then `requestEmail` is required.  `bitstreamId` is required
if `allfiles` is false.  `itemId` is always required.

The response is empty, generated token should not be exposed.

An appropriate person will be notified that the request has been filed.

Return codes:

* 201 CREATED - if the operation succeeded
* 401 UNAUTHORIZED - if anonymous requests are disabled and the session is unauthenticated
* 422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY - if the POSTed document could not be interpreted, the Item or Bitstream could not be found,
  or required fields are missing

## Accepting / Denying a Request

**PUT /api/tools/itemrequests/<:token>**

Anyone may accept or deny a request. Access is controlled by keeping the token confidential. The Content-Type is JSON.
Example:

```json
{
  "acceptRequest": true,
  "subject": "Request copy of document",
  "responseMessage": "Approved.  Documents attached.",
  "suggestOpenAccess": "false"
}
```

`acceptRequest` is required to set the status of a request.  `responseMessage`, `subject` and `suggestOpenAccess` are
not part of the request and are not stored. Other fields will be ignored -- requests are not updatable.

Additional Fields:

* responseMessage:  included in the body of the message sent to the requester. OPTIONAL.
* subject:  a subject line for the response message. OPTIONAL.
* suggestOpenAccess:  if `true`, trigger a message to repository administrators suggesting that access to the requested
  object(s) be opened. OPTIONAL.

Return codes:

* 200 OK - if the operation succeeded
* 401 UNAUTHORIZED - if the current session is anonymous
* 403 FORBIDDEN - if the current session is not authenticated to one of the configured approvers
* 422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY - if the request could not be found or `acceptRequest` was not specified.
