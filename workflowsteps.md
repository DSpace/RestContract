# Workflow Steps Endpoints

[Back to the list of all defined endpoints](endpoints.md)

A workflow step represents a single step in the reviewing process, e.g. the accept/reject step.

All endpoints mentioned here require authentication, but no specific permissions.

## Main Endpoint

**/api/config/workflowsteps**

The main endpoint is not implemented and a 405 error code is returned according to
our [general error response codes](README.md#Error-codes).

## Single Workflow Step Definition

**/api/config/workflowsteps/<:step-name>**

Provide detailed information about a specific workflow step. An example JSON response document:

```json
{
  "id": "editstep",
  "type": "workflowstep",
  "_links": {
    "workflowactions": {
      "href": "https://api7.dspace.org/server/api/config/workflowsteps/<:step-name>/workflowactions"
    }
  },
  "_embedded": {
    "workflowactions": [
      {
        "id": "editaction",
        "options": [
          "approve",
          "reject",
          "edit_metadata"
        ],
        "type": "workflowaction"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

It includes the list of workflow actions used in the workflow step. See [Workflow Actions Endpoints](workflowactions.md)
