# ORCID Queue Endpoints

[Back to the list of all defined endpoints](endpoints.md)

These endpoints allow to handle the Orcid Queue records associated with a specific profile.
Only the EPerson who is the owner of the Profile Item can access them.

When these records are processed lead to the creation of Orcid History records
(see [orcid history contract](orcidhistories.md) for more details).

These endpoints are only available when `orcid.synchronization-enabled=true`.
