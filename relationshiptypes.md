## Search methods

### Relationship types containing an entity type

**/api/core/relationshiptypes/search/byEntityType?type=<:entity-type-label>**

Parameters:

* The `type` should be the entity type label from the [entity types endpoint](entitytypes.md). It is mandatory. It can
  occur on either the left or right hand side

A sample search would be `/server/api/core/relationshiptypes/search/byEntityType?type=Publication`

Assuming that the sample `config/entities/relationship-types.xml` data model has been loaded, it would respond with

```json
{
  "_embedded": {
    "relationshiptypes": [
      {
        // it is between Person and Publication
