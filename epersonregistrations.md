# EPerson registration Endpoints

[Back to the list of all defined endpoints](endpoints.md)

## Main Endpoint

**GET /api/eperson/registrations**

As we don't have a use case to iterate over all the existent registrations, the main endpoint is not implemented and a
405 error code is returned according to our [general error response codes](README.md#Error-codes).

## Single EPerson registration

As we don't have a use case to retrieve an eperson registration based on the email, the single endpoint is not
implemented and a 405 error code is returned according to our [general error response codes](README.md#Error-codes).

## Search EPerson registration

**/api/eperson/registrations/search/findByToken?token=<:token>**

Exposes the registered email address based on the token.  
Also exposes whether it's a new user registration, or a password reset for an existing user.

```json
{
  "email": "user@institution.edu",
  "user": null,
  "type": "registration"
}
```

```json
{
  "email": "user@institution.edu",
  "user": "028dcbb8-0da2-4122-a0ea-254be49ca107",
  "type": "registration"
}
```

## Create new EPerson registration

**POST /api/eperson/registrations?accountRequestType={requestType_forgot_or_register}**

To create a new EPerson registration, perform a post with the JSON below to the eperson registrations endpoint (without
being authenticated).

```json
{
  "email": "user@institution.edu",
  "type": "registration"
}
```

Requires query parameter 'accountRequestType' set with either 'register' or 'forgot' value, depending on the action
requested.

No other properties can be set (e.g. the name cannot be defined)
If successful, an email will be sent with a token allowing the user to continue the registration

Verifying whether a new registration can be created can happen using the "epersonRegistration" [feature](features.md),
verified against the site

Status codes:

* 201 Created - if the operation succeed
* 400 Bad Request - if e.g. the query param 'accountRequestType' is not present or contains something else than forgot
  or register
* 401 Unauthorized - if registration is disabled, you are not authorized to create a new registration
* 422 Unprocessable Entity - if the email address was omitted or the e-mail address is in a domain that is not allowed
  in config `authentication-password.domain.valid`

## Forgot password

The same endpoint as [Create new EPerson registration](#create-new-eperson-registration) is used.

Using the same endpoint ensures it's not possible for a malicious user to identify which email addresses are registered
by attempting a registration and verifying whether the account exists
