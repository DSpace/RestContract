### Logo

#### Retrieve Logo

**GET /api/core/collections/<:uuid>/logo**

Example: <https://api7.dspace.org/server/#https://api7.dspace.org/server/api/core/collections/1c11f3f1-ba1f-4f36-908a-3f1ea9a557eb/logo>

It returns the bitstream representing the logo of this
collection. [See the bitstream endpoint for more info](bitstreams.md#Single Bitstream)

#### Create Logo

**POST /api/core/collections/<:uuid>/logo**

To be used on a collection without a logo

Curl example:

```bash
curl 'https://api7.dspace.org/server/api/core/collections/1c11f3f1-ba1f-4f36-908a-3f1ea9a557eb/logo' \
 -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
 -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJI...' \
 -F "file=@Downloads/test.png"
```

* The collection is determined using the ID in the URL
* The file is uploaded using multipart/form-data

It returns the created bitstream. [See the bitstream endpoint for more info](bitstreams.md#Single Bitstream)

The REST API can support Content-Length and Content-MD5 headers to verify integrity

Status codes:

* 201 Created - if the operation succeed
* 401 Unauthorized - if you are not authenticated
* 403 Forbidden - if you are not logged in with sufficient permissions

* 422 Unprocessable Entity - if there was no file, or if the collection already contains a logo

This endpoint only accepts one file at a time. If multiple files are uploaded, any extra files will be ignored.

#### Replace Logo

Replacing a logo will require deleting the logo and creating a new logo hereafter

#### Delete Logo

**DELETE /api/core/bitstreams/<:uuid>**

Use the [bitstream delete endpoint](bitstreams.md#delete-method) for removing the collection logo

If the bitstream is deleted, this automatically ensures the relationship between the collection and the logo is removed
as well.

}
```

* custom (**READ-ONLY**): can be true or false. True means that a custom license has been set for the collection
  otherwise the site license template is used and returned in the text attribute
* text: contains the textual value of the license template to use for submission in the collection

##### Retrieve collection administrators

**GET /api/core/collections/<:uuid>/adminGroup**

Example: /server/api/core/collections/7669c72a-3f2a-451f-a3b9-9210e7a4c02f/adminGroup

It returns the EPerson Group representing the administrators of this
collection. [See the EPerson Group endpoint for more info](epersongroups.md#single-eperson-group)

Return codes:

* 200 OK - if the admin group exists and is returned
* 204 No content - if the current collection exists but the admin group doesn't exist
* 401 Unauthorized - if you are not authenticated
* 403 Forbidden - if you are not logged in with sufficient permissions to retrieve the groups, parent community admins
  and collection admins can retrieve the group
* 404 Not found - if the current collection doesn't exist

##### Create collection administrators group

**POST /api/core/collections/<:uuid>/adminGroup**

To be used on a collection without collection administrators

Perform a post with the JSON below.

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "dc.description": [
      {
        "value": "Test group",
        "language": null,
        "authority": "",
        "confidence": -1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Contrary to the [EPerson Group endpoint](epersongroups.md#create-new-eperson-group), the name cannot be set here

Status codes:

* 201 Created - if the operation succeed
* 401 Unauthorized - if you are not authenticated
* 403 Forbidden - if you are not logged in with sufficient permissions. Only admins and parent community admins can
  retrieve the group
* 404 Not found - if the collection doesn't exist
* 422 Unprocessable Entity - if the name was included, if permanent was set to true, or if the collection already
  contains an administrator group

##### Modifying the collection administrators group

All modifications to the group will be performed directly on the Group endpoint:

* Adding members will need to use the [EPerson Group endpoint](epersongroups.md#add-an-eperson-to-a-parent-group)
* Adding sub-groups will need to use the [EPerson Group endpoint](epersongroups.md#add-a-group-to-a-parent-group)

Modifying the collection administrators group will be authorized for admins, parent community admins and collection
admins

##### Delete the collection administrators group

**DELETE /api/core/collections/<:uuid>/adminGroup**

To be used on a collection with an administrator group

Status codes:

* 204 No content - if the deletion succeeded (including the case of no-op if the collection didn't contain an
  administrator group)
* 401 Unauthorized - if you are not authenticated
* 403 Forbidden - if you are not logged in with sufficient permissions. Only admins, parent community admins and
  collection admins can delete the group
* 404 Not found - if the collection doesn't exist
* 422: if the collection didn't contain an administrator group

#### Collection Submitters

**/api/core/communities/<:uuid>/submittersGroup**

Endpoints for managing the Collection Submitters group

This works identical to the [Collection administrators](#collection-administrators),
except the collection administrators can also create the submitters group.

#### Collection Default item READ rights group

**/api/core/communities/<:uuid>/itemReadGroup**

Endpoints for managing the Collection Default item READ rights group

This works identical to the [Collection administrators](#collection-administrators),
except the collection administrators can also create the Collection Default item READ rights group.

#### Collection Default bitstream READ rights group

**/api/core/communities/<:uuid>/bitstreamReadGroup**

Endpoints for managing the Collection Default bitstream READ rights group

This works identical to the [Collection administrators](#collection-administrators),
except the collection administrators can also create the Collection Default bitstream READ rights group

#### Collection Workflow groups

**/api/core/communities/<:uuid>/workflowGroups/<:workflow-role>**

Endpoints for managing the Collection Workflow groups

This works similar to the [Collection administrators](#collection-administrators).  
The differences are:

* The collection administrators can also create the Collection Workflow groups
* The <:workflow-role> can be any role configured in the workflow with scope Collection. A HAL link for each of these
  groups will be included

The workflow role can be e.g.:

* reviewer
* editor
* finaleditor
* reviewmanagers

##### Delete a collection workflow group

**DELETE /api/core/communities/<:uuid>/workflowGroups/<:workflow-role>**

Error messages:

* 401 Unauthorized - if you are not authenticated
* 403 Forbidden - if you are not logged in with sufficient permissions
* 422 Unprocessable entity - if the role still has pending workflow tasks (deleting the group in that case may cause
  tasks to end up in an invalid state)

## Creating a collection

**POST /api/core/collections?parent=<:communityUUID>**

To create a collection, perform as post with the JSON below when logged in as admin.

```json
{
  "name": "test collection",
  "metadata": {
    "dc.title": [
      {
        "value": "test collection",
        "language": null,
        "authority": null,
        "confidence": -1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Error messages:

* 200 OK - if the operation succeed
* 401 Unauthorized - if you are not authenticated
* 403 Forbidden - if you are not logged in with sufficient permissions
* 422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY - if the parent community doesn't exist (the REST URI /api/core/collections still exists)

## Updating a collection

**PUT /api/core/collections/<:uuid>**

Provide updated metadata information about a specific collection, when the update is completed the updated object will
be returned. The JSON to update can be found below.

```json
{
  "uuid": "20263916-6a3d-4fdc-a44a-4616312f030c",
  "name": "test collection",
  "metadata": {
    "dc.title": [
      {
        "value": "test collection",
        "language": null,
        "authority": null,
        "confidence": -1
      }
    ],
    "dc.description": [
      {
        "value": "Test description",
        "language": null,
        "authority": null,
        "confidence": -1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```  

Error messages:

* 200 OK - if the operation succeed
* 401 Unauthorized - if you are not authenticated
* 403 Forbidden - if you are not logged in with sufficient permissions
* 404 Not found - if the collection doesn't exist
* 422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY - Altering one of the non-editable parameters will result in a 422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY
  error. The non-editable parameters are optional, but if they are specified, they have to remain identical to the
