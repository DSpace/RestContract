# CSRF Protection

[REST Overview Documentation](README.md)

All modifying requests (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, etc.) **require** that the client send a valid CSRF token
in the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header, otherwise a `403 Forbidden` error will occur.

The CSRF token is sent to the client in a prior request (often a `GET`) and may be changed during your session at any
time.
See [How does CSRF protection work in DSpace?](#how-does-csrf-protection-work-in-dspace) below for more details.

## What is CSRF and why is this necessary?

CSRF (or sometimes XSRF) refers to [Cross Site Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) attacks,
where
an end user may be tricked into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they are currently
authenticated.

DSpace
follows [OWASP guidelines to CSRF prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)
by
enabling [Spring Security's CSRF Protection](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/html5/#csrf)

DSpace uses a customized version
of [Spring Security's CSRF Protection](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/html5/#csrf)
which also works cross-domain (allowing clients to be on entirely separate domains from the REST API).
Please keep in mind that clients on other domains *must* still be trusted by the REST API by configuring
the [CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. This is configurable via the `rest.cors.allowed-origins` configuration in the
DSpace Backend.

## How does CSRF protection work in DSpace?

DSpace uses
a "[double submit cookie](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#double-submit-cookie)"
technique for CSRF protection.

Here's how it works:

1. The DSpace REST API generates a CSRF Token, storing it in a `HttpOnly` Cookie named `DSPACE-XSRF-COOKIE`, and sending
   it back to the client in a header named `DSPACE-XSRF-TOKEN`.
    * This token is often generated on your first request to the REST API, but may also
      be updated at any time.
    * If your REST API is running via HTTP, then the `DSPACE-XSRF-COOKIE` Cookie will be created with `SameSite=Lax`.
      This setting means that the cookie will not be sent (by your browser) to any other domains. Effectively, this will
      block all logins from any domain that is not the same as the REST API. Therefore, we only recommend HTTP in
      development environments.
    * If your REST API is running via HTTPS, then the `DSPACE-XSRF-COOKIE` Cookie will be created
      with `SameSite=None; Secure`. This setting means the cookie will be sent cross domain, but only for HTTPS
      requests. This is recommended for all Production environments.
2. The client **MUST** store/keep a copy of this CSRF token (usually by watching for the `DSPACE-XSRF-TOKEN` header in
   every response),
   and update that stored copy whenever a new token is sent.
    * For example, the [DSpace Angular UI](https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-angular) stores watches for this token from
      the `DSPACE-XSRF-TOKEN` header, and stores it in a client-side cookie named `XSRF-TOKEN` (as this is the default
      cookie name that Angular apps use for reading a CSRF token).
3. Whenever the client wishes to make a modifying request (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, etc.),
   the current CSRF token **MUST** be sent back in the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header of the request.
    * Keep in mind that [authentication](authentication.md) (via `/api/authn/login`) requires `POST` and therefore also
      requires a valid CSRF token.
    * NOTE: non-modifying requests (`GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, etc) do not require the token.
4. During a modifying request, the REST API will compare the value of the CSRF token in the request's
   `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header to the value in the `DSPACE-XSRF-COOKIE` Cookie. If the values match, the request proceeds.
   If the values do not match, a `403 Forbidden` error is returned.
    * Keep in mind that if the `DSPACE-XSRF-COOKIE` Cookie was blocked (or not sent back to the REST API) during this
      process, the same error will occur. So, you must ensure this Cookie is sent back (when using a browser this is
      usually done automatically, provided the `SameSite` settings allow it)
