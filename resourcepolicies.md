# Resource Policies Endpoints

[Back to the list of all defined endpoints](endpoints.md)

## Main Endpoint

**/api/authz/resourcepolicies**

As we don't have yet a use case to iterate over all the existent resource policies the main endpoint is not implemented
and a 405 error code is returned according to our [general error response codes](README.md#Error codes).

## Single Resource Policy

**/api/authz/resourcepolicies/<:id>**

Provide detailed information about a specific resource policy. The JSON response document is as follows:

## Creating a resource policy

**POST /api/authz/resourcepolicies?resource=<:uuid>&[eperson=<:uuid>|group=<:uuid>]**

Request body:

```json
{
  "name": null,
  "description": null,
  "policyType": "TYPE_SUBMISSION",
  "action": "READ",
  "startDate": null,
  "endDate": null,
  "type": "resourcepolicy"
}
```

The parameters are:

* resource: mandatory, the uuid of the resource target of the policy
* eperson: the uuid of the eperson that will be grant of the permission. Exactly one of eperson or group is required
* group: the uuid of the group that will be grant of the permission. Exactly one of eperson or group is required

The json body must be valid that mean

- type must be resourcepolicy
- policyType must be one of the value specified in the GET description
- action must be one of the value specified in the GET description
- startDate / endDate if present must respect the format specified in the GET description

## Patch operations

### Add

The add operation allows to initialize or replace information with new one.

To set a startDate

```bash
curl --data '[ { "op": "add", "path": "/startDate", "value": "2019-10-31" }]' -H "Authorization: Bearer ..." -H "content-type: application/json" -X PATCH ${dspace7-url}/api/authz/resourcepolicies/${resourcepolicy-id}
```

```json
{
  "id": 2844,
  "name": null,
  "description": null,
  "policyType": "TYPE_SUBMISSION",
  "action": "READ",
  "startDate": null,
  "endDate": null,
  "type": "resourcepolicy"
}
```

the add operation will result in:

```json
{
  "id": 2844,
  "name": null,
  "description": null,
  "policyType": "TYPE_SUBMISSION",
  "action": "READ",
  "startDate": "2019-10-31",
  "endDate": null,
  "type": "resourcepolicy"
}
```

To set a name and a description

```bash
curl --data '[ { "op": "add", "path": "/name", "value": "my name" }, { "op": "add", "path": "/description", "value": "my description"}]' -H "Authorization: Bearer ..." -H "content-type: application/json" -X PATCH ${dspace7-url}/api/authz/resourcepolicies/${resourcepolicy-id}
```

```json
{
  "id": 2844,
  "name": null,
  "description": null,
  "policyType": "TYPE_SUBMISSION",
  "action": "READ",
  "startDate": "2019-10-31",
  "endDate": null,
  "type": "resourcepolicy"
}
```

the add operation will result in:

```json
{
  "id": 2844,
  "name": "my name",
  "description": "my description",
  "policyType": "TYPE_SUBMISSION",
  "action": "READ",
  "startDate": "2019-10-31",
  "endDate": null,
  "type": "resourcepolicy"
}
```

Return codes, see also general [return codes for PATCH requests](patch.md#error-codes):

* 200 Ok if the path operation succeed. The updated resource policy is included in the response
* 401 Unauthorized - if you are not authenticated
* 403 Forbidden - if you are not logged in with sufficient permissions. Only system administrators or user with ADMIN
  permission over the target resource can use the endpoint
* 404 Not found - if the resource policy doesn't exist (or was already deleted)

### Remove

With the `remove` operation, you can delete:

- startDate
- endDate
- name
- description

the other properties cannot be nullified.

To remove an embargo you can for instance use the following
`curl --data '[ { "op": "remove", "path": "/startDate" }]' -H "Authorization: Bearer ..." -H "content-type: application/json" -X PATCH ${dspace7-url}/api/authz/resourcepolicies/${resourcepolicy-id}`

that will transform

```json
{
  "id": 2844,
  "name": "my name",
  "description": "my description",
  "policyType": "TYPE_SUBMISSION",
  "action": "READ",
  "startDate": "2019-10-31",
  "endDate": null,
  "type": "resourcepolicy"
}
```

in

```json
{
  "id": 2844,
  "name": "my name",
  "description": "my description",
  "policyType": "TYPE_SUBMISSION",
  "action": "READ",
  "startDate": null,
  "endDate": null,
  "type": "resourcepolicy"
}
```

Return codes, see also general [return codes for PATCH requests](patch.md#error-codes):

* 200 Ok if the path operation succeed. The updated resource policy is included in the response
* 401 Unauthorized - if you are not authenticated
* 403 Forbidden - if you are not logged in with sufficient permissions. Only system administrators or user with ADMIN
  permission over the target resource can use the endpoint
* 404 Not found - if the resource policy doesn't exist (or was already deleted)

### Replace

The replace operation allows to replace *existent* information with new one. Attempt to use the replace operation to set
not yet initialized information must return an error. See [general errors on PATCH requests](patch.md)

To change the startDate

```bash
curl --data '[ { "op": "replace", "path": "/startDate", "value": "2020-01-01" }]' -H "Authorization: Bearer ..." -H "content-type: application/json" -X PATCH ${dspace7-url}/api/authz/resourcepolicies/${resourcepolicy-id}
```

For example, starting with the following item data:

```json
{
  "id": 2844,
  "name": null,
  "description": null,
  "policyType": "TYPE_SUBMISSION",
  "action": "READ",
  "startDate": "2019-10-31",
  "endDate": null,
  "type": "resourcepolicy"
}
```

the replace operation will result in:

```json
{
  "id": 2844,
  "name": null,
  "description": null,
  "policyType": "TYPE_SUBMISSION",
  "action": "READ",
  "startDate": "2020-01-01",
  "endDate": null,
  "type": "resourcepolicy"
}
```

Return codes, see also general [return codes for PATCH requests](patch.md#error-codes):

* 200 Ok if the path operation succeed. The updated resource policy is included in the response
* 401 Unauthorized - if you are not authenticated
* 403 Forbidden - if you are not logged in with sufficient permissions. Only system administrators or user with ADMIN
  permission over the target resource can use the endpoint
* 404 Not found - if the resource policy doesn't exist (or was already deleted)

Return codes:

* 204 No content - if the operation succeed
* 401 Unauthorized - if you are not authenticated
* 403 Forbidden - if you are not logged in with sufficient permissions. Only system administrators or user with ADMIN
