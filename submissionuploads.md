# SubmissionUploads Endpoints

[Back to the list of all defined endpoints](endpoints.md)

The proposed structure is derived from the configuration options already available in DSpace 6 and below. In the first
implementation, a single configuration named *default* is expected as these configurations were set at the site level.
Introducing an endpoint to manage a collection of configurations we open the door to future extension where different
setups can be used for different kind of submissions (theses, technical reports, journal articles, etc.)

## Main Endpoint

**/api/config/submissionuploads**

Provide access to the existent configurations for the submission upload. It returns the list of existent
SubmissionUploadConfig.
The SubmissionUploadConfig aggregates in a single place the configuration needed to the upload section such as the max
allowed size for the files, the access condition options, etc.

Example: to be provided

## Single Submission-Form

**/api/config/submissionuploads/<:upload-name>**

*:upload-name* is initially hard-coded to *default*

Provide detailed information about a specific input-form. The JSON response document is as follows:

```json
{
  "id": "default",
  "required": true,
  "max-size": 536870912,
  "accessConditionOptions": [
    {
      "name": "openaccess"
    },
    {
      "name": "administrator"
    },
    {
      "name": "embargo",
      "hasStartDate": true,
      "maxStartDate": "2018-06-24T00:40:54.970+0000"
    },
    {
      "name": "lease",
      "hasEndDate": true,
      "maxEndDate": "2017-12-24T00:40:54.970+0000"
    }
  ]
}

```

The attributes of the objects in the accessConditionOptions arrays are as follows:

* The *name* attribute is an identifier that can be used by the REST client (the UI) to present the different options to
  the user, maybe translating it in a human-readable format using i18n, and by the backend to create the ResourcePolicy
  to apply to the uploaded file using and validating the additional inputs provided by the user where required.
* If there is a *hasStartDate* attribute and it is true, the access condition to be applied requires to specify a
  startDate that must be less or equal than the value of the *maxStartDate* attribute (if null any date is acceptable)
* If there is a *hasEndDate* attribute and it is true, the access condition to be applied requires to specify an endDate
  that must be less or equal than the value of the *maxEndDate* attribute (if null any date is acceptable). If a
  startDate is supplied the endDate must be greater than the startDate

A null value for the accessConditionOptions attribute means that the upload step doesn't allow the user to set a policy
for the file. The file will get only the policies inherited from the collection.

Exposed links:

* metadata: it is a link to the submission-form to use for the files metadata
