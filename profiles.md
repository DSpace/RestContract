# Researcher profiles Endpoints

[Back to the list of all defined endpoints](endpoints.md)

This repository allows to manage the profile item linked to a particular eperson. The specific type of item
with which the profile is modeled depends on the dspace configuration (by default it is the Person type). If the
particular dspace instance doesn't handle the "profile"
type then these endpoints are disabled.

## Get all Profile

**GET /api/eperson/profiles/**

This operation is not currently supported.

## Single Profile

**GET /api/eperson/profiles/<:eperson-uuid>**

Provide information about a specific profile. Only the Administrators or the owner eperson can access this endpoint.

The JSON response document is as follows:

```json
{
  "id": "eb645ef8-1373-41eb-bf67-6afcea7e2069",
  "visible": true,
  "orcid": "0000-0002-8310-6788",
  "orcidSynchronization": {
    "mode": "MANUAL",
    "publicationsPreference": "ALL",
    "projectsPreference": "ALL",
    "profilePreferences": [
      "BIOGRAPHICAL",
      "IDENTIFIERS"
    ]
  },
  "type": "profile"
}
```

Attributes:

* id: the UUID of the EPerson who owns the profile. This also corresponds to the ID of the profile.
* visible: this property provides a quick way to add/remove the Anonymous READ policy. When set to "true", then the
  Anonymous READ Policy is added (and the profile becomes accessible to anonymous users). When set to "false", then the
  Anonymous READ policy is removed (and the profile is no longer accessible anonymously). Keep in mind, this setting
  only impacts the Anonymous READ policy. So, if other custom READ policies exist on the profile, those policies will
  take effect when "visible=false".
* orcid: the orcid id
* orcidSynchronization: contains the orcid synchronization mode and preferences
* type: the resource type (profile)

The orcid and orcidSynchronization attributes are not showed if the given profile is not linked to any ORCID account.

Exposed links:

* item: the item with which the profile is modeled
* eperson: the eperson related to the profile

It would respond with:

* 200 OK - Returning the profile if there's a match
* 401 Unauthorized - if you are not authenticated
* 403 Forbidden - if you are not logged in with sufficient permissions to view the profile
* 404 Not found - if the profile or the eperson doesn't exist
